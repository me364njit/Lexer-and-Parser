# Lexer-and-Parser

**File: lex.cpp**

This file appears to be part of a lexical analyzer (lexer) for a programming language. It is responsible for converting the input source code into a sequence of tokens. Each token represents a meaningful unit in the programming language, like keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, and more. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- **Includes:** The necessary standard library headers and other headers are included. This code relies on the `<cctype>` and `<map>` headers.

- **Namespace and Using Directives:** The `std` namespace and the `using` directives are used to avoid qualifying standard library entities with the `std::` prefix.

- **Token Printing:** A `map` called `tokenPrint` is defined to map each token to its corresponding string representation. This mapping is later used to print tokens for debugging or display purposes.

- **Keyword Mapping:** Another `map` called `kwmap` is defined to map keywords to their corresponding token types. This is used to differentiate between identifiers and keywords.

- **Overloaded Operator `<<`:** An overloaded `<<` operator function is defined to print a `LexItem` object, which represents a token along with its lexeme and line number.

- **Function `id_or_kw`:** This function determines whether a lexeme is an identifier or a keyword. If it's a keyword, it returns the corresponding token; otherwise, it returns an identifier token.

- **Function `getNextToken`:** This is the main function responsible for tokenizing the input stream. It reads characters from the input stream and processes them to determine the next token. It utilizes a state machine (`lexstate`) to track the current state of the lexer and decides how to categorize the input characters.

**File: lex.h**

This header file contains the definitions of various tokens, the `LexItem` class, and function prototypes for tokenization-related functions. It's used to provide necessary structures and declarations for the lexer.

**File: parse.h**

This header file seems to be related to parsing the tokens generated by the lexer. It defines various function prototypes that handle the parsing of different parts of the programming language's syntax. Functions like `Prog`, `StmtList`, `Stmt`, `ControlStmt`, `DeclStmt`, and others are prototypes for parsing specific language constructs.

Overall, dealing with a codebase for a lexer and potentially a parser for a programming language. These components are essential for building a compiler or interpreter for a programming language, as they are responsible for analyzing the input code's structure and semantics.
